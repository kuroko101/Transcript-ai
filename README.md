Why Transcription?
Transcribing audio files into text can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have a large volume of audio data that needs to be transcribed. Fortunately, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to automate this process and make it much faster and more efficient.

In this article, I will discuss an ML application that I built which can transcribe audio files into text in four different languages: English, French, Spanish, and Arabic. The front end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end code relies heavily on Python.

How does it work?
The application works by first taking an audio file as input. The audio file is then converted into a digital signal using a library called Libros. This digital signal is then passed through a neural network that has been trained on speech recognition data in the four languages.

The neural network consists of several layers of nodes that perform various computations on the input signal. The output of the neural network is a sequence of phonemes, which are the smallest units of sound in a language.

Once the phonemes have been identified, they are combined into words using a language model. The language model uses statistical analysis to determine the most likely sequence of words that match the phonemes.

Finally, the transcribed text is displayed on the front end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Challenges
One of the key challenges of building this application was training the neural network on speech recognition data in multiple languages. I had to collect large amounts of data in each language and then use this data to train separate neural networks for each language.

I also had to carefully design the language model to ensure that it could accurately match phonemes to words in each language. This required a deep understanding of the unique characteristics of each language, such as its grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.

Despite these challenges, we were able to successfully build an ML application that can transcribe audio files into text in four different languages. This application has many potential use cases, such as transcribing interviews, lectures, and meetings.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the use of machine learning algorithms to automate speech recognition is an exciting field with many promising applications. Our application, which can transcribe audio files into text in English, French, Spanish, and Arabic, is just one example of the potential of this technology. As more data becomes available and our understanding of speech recognition improves, we can expect to see even more advanced applications in the future.
